          Hi, <span class="paren-black">(</span><span class="red italic chat-placeholder">student name</span><span class="paren-black">)</span>! This is <span class="paren-black">(</span><span class="red italic chat-placeholder">advisor name</span><span class="paren-black">)</span>, your Admissions Advisor from CTU and <strong>we are speaking on a recorded line.</strong> How are you?
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I want to talk about how you can incorporate school into your daily routine, check the status of your transcripts and financial aid, and show you a couple more items on the Virtual Campus. Please grab a pen and something to take notes on.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's talk about your daily schedule. We briefly discussed your schedule during our interview, but remind me; what does your typical day look like?
        </p>

        <p>
          When do you normally have free time that you could devote to school?
        </p>

        <p class="military-only">
          Will you have any deployments or annual training?
        </p>

        <p class="red italic">
          Help your student create a tentative schedule for their first session.
        </p>

        <p class="red italic">
          If your student needs additional support, provide the Time Management activity located on the VC &gt; Student Services &gt; Access the Student Success Center &gt; Student Success Skills &gt; Time Management.

          Let's review the status of your transcripts.

            <p class="script-content-text">Like we discussed previously, one of the Admissions requirements is having proof of high school graduation. Do you have a copy of your diploma?</p>
            <p class="script-content-text">When you have it ready, you can take a picture of it with your phone and upload it using the mobile app. Would you like me to walk you through that now so we can check it off the list?</p>

            <p class="script-content-text">As you know, we need to obtain all your official college transcripts. A transcript is only considered official when it is sent directly from the issuing school, either in a sealed envelope mailed to us or sent electronically directly to our Registrar. CTU takes the initiative to help collect these, but it is your responsibility to ensure all transcripts are on file. Keep an eye on your email; if any of your prior schools don't accept an electronic signature, we may send you a new transcript request form asking you to wet sign it.</p>
            <p class="script-content-text">If you happen to have any unofficial transcripts or can print them from your school's website, I encourage you to send those to us. Our Registrar Evaluation Services (RES) department can review unofficial transcripts while we wait for your officials. Do you have a copy of your unofficial transcripts or access to your school's website to print them from there?</p>
