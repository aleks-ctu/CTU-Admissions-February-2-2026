          show you how to use CTU Messenger, and help you download the mobile app. How does that sound?

              The first step is to register for your FSA ID that you'll later use to sign your FAFSA. It's a good idea to add your cell phone number
              in case you ever get locked out of your account. Let me know once you've successfully created your FSA ID and see a link to studentaid.gov.

            <p>
              Go ahead and click that link, then select the 2025-2026 FAFSA. It takes less than an hour to complete your FAFSA. The sooner you fill it out,
              the sooner we can determine your eligibility. You will need your 2023 tax information and CTU's school code which is 010148. If you don't have
              your taxes right now, it's ok, we can still get started, but you will need them at some point to complete the FAFSA.
