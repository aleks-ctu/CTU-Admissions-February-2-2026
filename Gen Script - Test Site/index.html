                    <p>Let's talk about what our virtual campus has to offer. The virtual campus is where you will access your classes, financial aid documents, our learning center and student resources including the library, books, and tutoring. To get familiar with the virtual campus, we offer weekly live tours that you can join.</p>
                    
                    <p>CTU's curriculum is designed to challenge you to organize, research and solve real-world problems. We refer to this as our Professional Learning Model. When classes begin, you'll have live or recorded live chats and assignments each week. Your assignments may be a discussion board, an individual project, a group project, or intellipath® <span class="cos-toggle-text" style="display: none;">(for COS: worksheets, presentation, simulations, tests)</span>. Intellipath® is our proprietary educational technology, which is an adaptive learning platform. Have you ever heard of that? Adaptive learning technology recognizes what you already know, anticipates what you're ready to learn, and personalizes your course materials accordingly.</p>

                    <p><strong>ONL:</strong> Before classes start, you'll go through Orientation which gives you a chance to get familiar with the virtual classroom and the various types of assignments.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="section-subheading">CTU Messenger & CTU Student Community</h3>
                    
                    <p>It's important for students to stay connected with CTU. One way to do that is with CTU Messenger. This is a two-way communication platform that allows you to easily chat with your advisors, instructors, and other departments. A lot of our students like the convenience of this tool because they may not be able to call us but can still get questions answered. It's easily accessible from the mobile app and a computer. Are you comfortable using instant messaging?</p>
                    
                    <p>Another way for students to connect is with our CTU Student Community. This is a social media platform that connects you with other CTU students based on common interests.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="section-subheading">Recognition & Graduation</h3>
                    
                    <p>I want to also share with you some of our recognition. CTU's online degree programs are ranked among the best in 2025 by U.S. News & World Report, which is a globally respected organization and authority in education rankings. 2025 was our eleventh consecutive year for this ranking.</p>
                    
                    <p>Something else our students are often curious about is if we have a graduation ceremony. CTU has in-person and virtual graduation ceremonies. It's a pretty exciting experience and we also stream it live for students who may not be able to attend. When you think ahead about graduation, who would you invite to see you graduate?</p>
                    
                    <p>Let's talk about program length, financial aid, and tuition. Before we do what questions do you have about what I just shared?</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="section-subheading">Program Length</h3>
                    
                    <p>Typically, students start with one class. This helps students build confidence in their study habits, time management skills, and their academic abilities before taking on a heavier course load.</p>

Our Finance Advisors will provide you with the correct information you'll need to fill out your TA application and answer any questions you may have.</p>

                    <p>Have you thought about how you're going to fund your education?</p>
                    
                    <p>Ok, you will work with a CTU Finance Advisor and they'll help guide you through the financial aid process, but I can cover the basics for you.</p>
                    
                    <p>When people think of financial aid they typically think of the FAFSA which is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and is available for those who apply and qualify. However, it's important to know that financial aid is actually a combination of sources which may include federal grants and loans, institutional grants or scholarships, private educational loans, or tuition assistance. Students also have the option to set up a payment plan. Does that make sense? The first step in the process is to fill out the FAFSA. I'll help you get started with that in a few minutes.</p>

                        <p>Now let's talk about how you can potentially save time and money with CTU Fast Track™. Fast Track allows you to test out of courses with a 70% <span class="conditional-text">(80% for MSHCM)</span> or higher at no additional cost, which means you may be able to graduate earlier and save on your total program cost. The exams are non-transferable courses.</p>
                        <p>Your program has a total of <span class="underline-placeholder">___</span> Fast Track exams that are available in the (<span class="placeholder placeholder-not-bold">insert degree program and specialization/concentration</span>). If you take and pass all of the Fast Track exams available <strong>in your program, the remaining program credits would be <span class="underline-placeholder">___</span> and your remaining tuition cost would be <span class="underline-placeholder">___</span></strong>. However, <strong>you should not rely on potential Fast Track savings or eligibility</strong> when making an enrollment decision. Is this something you'd be interested in?</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>CTU offers something called the Master's Advantage which allows students the option to substitute two undergraduate level courses for two graduate courses. The benefit of doing this is that those two courses are charged at the undergraduate cost per credit hour rate rather than the graduate cost per credit hour rate. There are some eligibility requirements that would be monitored during your program, but if you'd like to be considered, I can indicate that when you enroll.</p>
                        <p class="conditional-instruction"><span class="conditional-text"><em>Reminder: If the PS wants Master's Advantage, indicate this in the comments section in APC for online or notes section of Audit Request for ground when you submit the enrollment.</em></span></p>
