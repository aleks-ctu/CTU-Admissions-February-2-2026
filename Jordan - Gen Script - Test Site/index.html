                        <p>For courses that are offered on campus you may need to meet in person once or twice a week, and typically in the evening. For the courses that are offered online, you won't have any mandatory log in times, but you will have to participate regularly. There will be some courses that are a mix, meaning you may be required to meet in person and virtually during the duration of your course</p>
                        <p class="conditional-text">Check the list of courses offered on campus for the upcoming start and inform the PS if they will take their first class on campus or online.</p>
                        <p><strong>If VA:</strong> To ensure that our VA students have the opportunity to be certified for the full Monthly Housing Allowance benefit; CTU is offering a select number of campus-based courses with in-person meeting times, as well as in-person lecture events on campus. Students receive an email upon enrollment with more details about the meeting times.</p>

                        <p>CTU has a laptop program for eligible students. Financial Aid will discuss eligibility and funding during the packaging process. The laptop will be yours to keep and comes with resources already installed to help you log in to the Virtual Campus, download Microsoft 365, connect with CTU Technical Support, and access the warranty process. Laptops don't ship until after classes begin, so you will need to have access to a computer with internet until you receive your laptop. Is this something you'd be interested in?</p>
                        <p class="conditional-instruction"><span class="conditional-text">If PS is interested, review the laptop specs and cost using the <a href="#" class="link">CTU Admissions FAQs</a> (CTU Laptop Program & Computer Access), and let them know you will inform FA so they can discuss it further when you transfer during the Welcome Call.</span></p>

                    <p>Let's talk about what our virtual campus has to offer. The virtual campus is where you will access your classes, financial aid documents, our learning center and student resources including the library, books, and tutoring. To get familiar with the virtual campus, we offer weekly live tours that you can join.</p>
                    
                    <p>CTU's curriculum is designed to challenge you to organize, research and solve real-world problems. We refer to this as our Professional Learning Model. When classes begin, you'll have live or recorded live chats and assignments each week. Your assignments may be a discussion board, an individual project, a group project, or intellipath® <span class="cos-toggle-text" style="display: none;">(for COS: worksheets, presentation, simulations, tests)</span>. Intellipath® is our proprietary educational technology, which is an adaptive learning platform. Have you ever heard of that? Adaptive learning technology recognizes what you already know, anticipates what you're ready to learn, and personalizes your course materials accordingly.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading">CTU Messenger & CTU Student Community</h3>
                    
                    <p>It's important for students to stay connected with CTU. One way to do that is with CTU Messenger. This is a two-way communication platform that allows you to easily chat with your advisors, instructors, and other departments. A lot of our students like the convenience of this tool because they may not be able to call us but can still get questions answered. It's easily accessible from the mobile app and a computer. Are you comfortable using instant messaging?</p>
                    
                    <p>Another way for students to connect is with our CTU Student Community. This is a social media platform that connects you with other CTU students based on common interests.</p>
                    
                    <div class="separator"></div>
                    
                    <h3 class="section-subheading">Recognition & Graduation</h3>
                    
                    <p>I want to also share with you some of our recognition. CTU's online degree programs are ranked among the best in 2025 by U.S. News & World Report, which is a globally respected organization and authority in education rankings. 2025 was our eleventh consecutive year for this ranking.</p>
                    
                    <p>Something else our students are often curious about is if we have a graduation ceremony. CTU has in-person and virtual graduation ceremonies. It's a pretty exciting experience and we also stream it live for students who may not be able to attend. When you think ahead about graduation, who would you invite to see you graduate?</p>
                    
                    <p>Let's talk about program length, financial aid, and tuition. Before we do what questions do you have about what I just shared?</p>
                    
                    <div class="separator"></div>
                    
                    <h3 class="section-subheading">Program Length</h3>
                    
                    <p>Typically, students start with one class. This helps students build confidence in their study habits, time management skills, and their academic abilities before taking on a heavier course load.</p>
