          (After you have introduced yourself as scripted in the Admissions Call Script.)

        <p>
          Thanks for letting me know, I can call you back when it's more convenient. What time later today works better? <span class="red italic">Set the appointment for a specific day, date, and time</span> <span class="red italic">the same day or next day.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          During our meeting, we'll talk more about your educational goals, what CTU offers, and answer any questions you may have. Let me quickly verify that we have the correct email and phone number on file for you. <span class="red italic">Confirm the email address is accurate and the phone number is the best number for the PS to be reached.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          What questions do you have before I let you go? <span class="red italic">If PS engages, strive to transition to the script as time allows.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, my name is <span class="red italic chat-placeholder">(state your first and last name)</span>, and you'll receive an email from me with information about CTU and my phone number. I'll talk to you at <span class="red italic chat-placeholder">(repeat day, date, and time).</span>
