                        <p>You can complete your FAFSA<span class="trademark-reg">®</span> at any time, even prior to enrollment. The FAFSA<span class="trademark-reg">®</span> is the document that the Federal Government uses to determine your eligibility for different types of federal aid. On your FAFSA<span class="trademark-reg">®</span>, you will select which school you would like your information sent to by providing our school code. We encourage students to complete the Application for Admission first if they have indicated they are ready to move forward with CTU. This helps to ensure that the school can properly connect your FAFSA<span class="trademark-reg">®</span> to your student file in order to prepare and respond more quickly once we receive the FAFSA<span class="trademark-reg">®</span> results. Once we've received your results, your CTU Finance Advisor will be able to assist you in determining how to apply any eligible funding options that may be available to cover the cost of your program here at CTU.</p>

                        <p>I understand. The decision to take out loans is important and requires your thoughtful consideration. Borrowing is a great responsibility and, as you may know, loans must be repaid along with associated fees and interest. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that other funding sources, like grants and scholarships, would be enough to cover the full cost of tuition. Our Financial Aid Department can provide you with more information about the different types of aid that may be available to you if you qualify.</p>

                        <p>Accreditation provides educational institutions with an objectively recognized standard of quality to which they must adhere. The purpose of accreditation is to assess the educational quality of an institution, promote internal accountability and consistency with an institution's policies, promote institutional effectiveness through various assessments, and to monitor an institution's ability to effectively carry out its operations.</p>

                        <p>CTU utilizes quarter credit hours. Quarter credit hours are approximately two-thirds of a semester credit hour in terms of course work load. Nine quarter credit hours are equivalent to approximately six semester hours. A school that operates on a quarter hour system typically requires 180 quarter credit hours to complete a bachelor's degree. A school that operates on a semester hour system, typically requires 120 semester credit hours to complete a bachelor's degree.</p>

As part of your enrollment you will be asked about any criminal background you may have. In an effort to maintain a safe educational and working environment for students and staff, CTU does not accept applicants who are known to have certain types of criminal convictions in their backgrounds. Admitted students who are discovered to have misrepresented their criminal conviction history to CTU are subject to immediate dismissal. Similarly, students who commit certain types of crimes while enrolled are subject to immediate dismissal. As such, students convicted of any criminal offense while enrolled must report that conviction to the school within ten (10) days of receiving the conviction. Students who fail to report a criminal conviction while enrolled are subject to immediate dismissal. CTU reserves the right to conduct criminal background checks on applicants and students in circumstances deemed appropriate by CTU.</p>

                        <p>Currently, the school/facility you attended does not meet our high school graduation requirements, and we are unable to process your application at this time. I encourage you to contact the Department of Education at 877-433-7827 for additional information about your high school diploma/GED completion.</p>
                        <p>If you have previously attended college, we can review those transcripts to see if they may satisfy the proof of high school graduation. If you didn't include any prior institution on your application, I can direct you how to fill out a transcript request form for any that you didn't already include.</p>
                        <p>If you have not previously attended college and your proof of high school graduation was rejected, you could take and pass a GED exam. If you choose to do that, we will need to cancel your enrollment to allow time for the GED to be taken and awarded prior to starting at CTU. We can help you return to CTU upon earning your GED.</p>
